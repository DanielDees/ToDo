# ToDo
ToDo App Example for Resume

# Installation and Setup.
In order to run the application, first download the project and place it in whichever directory you want.

To setup the database, use a DB manager like SequelPro and create a new database. In the ToDo project folder, you will notice a subfolder called "init". Import the ToDo_DB.sql file to SequelPro and run it. This will create the necessary database structure for the application to run.
 
# Running the application
To run the ToDo app, navigate to the project folder's location in your terminal and run a local PHP server. Ex: php -S localhost:3000

Once the server is running, simply open up a browser (Google Chrome recommended), and go to localhost.
